Welcome to scikit-groups' documentation!
========================================

scikit-groups is a framework for creating mathematical groups and experimenting with them in python. Read the paper_ we produced earlier in the year to get an idea of the kind of problems we will be solving as we develop this package. All of the code used in the paper is available at my github account_.

The project is in its infancy at the moment, but we do have the following short to medium term goals:

1. Producing a developer guide

2. Developing use cases and show casing interesting solutions 

3. Continuous integration test cases

To get involved, drop us a note on the following irc channel

   :maxdepth: 2
